# Injector

Inject a responsive iframe into a page.

> We can use JavaScript to communicate between the iframe and the top-level page. With one slight problem â€” due to the same-origin policy an iframe at a different domain can't use JavaScript to directly communicate with the parent page.  Instead we have to use the postMessage() method to do cross-window messaging.
